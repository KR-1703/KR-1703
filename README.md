- **Wireframing & Prototyping:** I use wireframing and prototyping tools to bring ideas to life, allowing for early user testing and feedback.

- **User Research:** Understanding the target audience is at the core of my design process. I conduct user research to gain insights that inform design decisions.

- **Usability Testing:** To ensure the effectiveness of my designs, I regularly conduct usability testing and iterate based on user feedback.

## My Toolbox

- **Design Tools:** Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, and more.

- **Prototyping:** InVision, Marvel, Principle.
